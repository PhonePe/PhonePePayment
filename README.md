PhonePe Intent SDK for iOS provides a simple integration that you can use in your iOS application to process your Transactions through the PhonePe ecosystem.

If the PhonePe app is installed on the customer device, that is opened and once the user has completed the transaction they are redirected back to your application seamlessly.

If the PhonePe app is not installed, then the transaction is processed via a WKWebView embed without any intervention requirement by the merchant.

$ open PhonePePaymentExample.xcworkspace
```

__Step 3__: Insert your client ID and client secret

Set your MERCHANT_ID, SALT_KEY and SALT_INDEX values to the sample app in the `Constant.swift` file in the sample app. If You don't have it please contact us at merchant-integration@phonepe.com
```swift
let slatIndex: Int = 0 //YOUR SALT INDEX
let salt: String = "YOUR SALT KEY GOES HERE"
let merchantId: String = "YOUR MERCHANT ID HERE GOES HERE"
```

__Step 4__: <span id="step_4"><span> Set LSApplicationQueriesSchemes

In your Info.plist, create or append a new Array type node LSApplicationQueriesSchemes to append the following values:

```swift
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
        <string>ppemerchantsdkv1</string>
        <string>ppemerchantsdkv2</string>
